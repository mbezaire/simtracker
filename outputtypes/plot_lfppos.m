function plot_lfpposition(handles)

% read in all lfp files

% match up the gids with their positions

% make a matrix of unique x and y positions

% make a heat map of x by y, whose colors depend on LFP voltage, that is
% animated thru time

% make some line graphs of particular regions: time by voltage (subtly
% changing colors as a function of position)
